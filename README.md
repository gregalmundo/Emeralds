If completing your degree sounds like too much to take on right now, you also have the option of taking up to four courses as a non-matriculated student.

Each course is designed and led by a distinguished professor from the Gilder Lehrman Institute’s network of scholars. Lectures can be viewed asynchronously, allowing for maximum flexibility. In addition to video lectures, students will engage in live, face-to-face discussions with their professor during digital Q&A sessions.

Each section of a course has an adjunct instructor to guide day-to-day course work and communication. These Pace University instructors are well versed in distance-learning best practices and are dedicated to student success. They assess all student work, prompt and moderate discussion boards, and help students with course material and questions.

The Pace–Gilder Lehrman MA in American History Program is open to K–12 educators (including district supervisors, librarians, museum professionals, and National Park Service employees) who are affiliated with the Gilder Lehrman Institute. Please read the MA Program FAQs for more information on eligibility. Affordable on a teacher’s salary and manageable while working full time, these courses are designed for K–12 educators. This is a unique opportunity for teachers from the Gilder Lehrman Institute and Pace University.
